    <h1>Here Are A Few Tips For Finding The Best Solar Installers Near You</h1>
    <p>
      Solar energy has witnessed massive growth and tech advancement in the last
      10 years. Eco-friendly fixes have made the idea of installing solar panels
      more and more popular. The falling cost of installation and the rising
      value of government incentives have also contributed to the appeal of
      solar systems in cities around the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      For families thinking of installing solar now, there are multiple options
      to choose from. The differences between providers can be complicated to
      discern. Often the best decision for your home will be determined by
      calling the&nbsp;<a href="https://jna.org/solar/">best solar installers</a
      >&nbsp;in your area.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this is all new to you, then the important thing is to read up on the
      services that solar installers provide. According to the&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/solar-photovoltaic-installers.htm"
        rel="noopener"
        target="_blank"
        >Bureau of Labor and Statistics</a
      >, &ldquo;Solar photovoltaic (PV) installers assemble, set up, and
      maintain rooftop or other systems that convert sunlight into
      energy&hellip;Most solar panel installations are done outdoors, but PV
      installers sometimes work in attics and crawl spaces to connect panels to
      the electrical grid.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      There may be many service providers in your area, with a pretty solid
      reputation. So, it&rsquo;ll be incumbent upon you to ask direct questions
      about energy usage, the layout of the roof or garden, and the short-term
      and long-term costs. There are five steps to finding the&nbsp;best solar
      companies&nbsp;near you.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://jna.org/solars/sunpower/">SunPower</a> has a network of
      trusted installers for your solar system, solar panels, and electricity
      needs.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>1. Understand the Costs and Credits</h2>

    <p>
      According to the&nbsp;<a
        href="https://sites.energycenter.org/solar/homeowners/cost"
        rel="noopener"
        target="_blank"
        >Center for Sustainable Energy</a
      >, &ldquo;The cost of a solar electric system is measured in dollars per
      watt. The average cost for a residential system is
      currently&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$3 to $5 per watt</strong>.&nbsp; That means
      the average 5-kW residential system will cost&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong
        >$15,000 to $25,000</strong
      >,&nbsp; prior to tax credits or incentives.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Federal solar tax credits and other available incentives offer significant
      value. According to the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics"
        rel="noopener"
        target="_blank"
        >Homeowner&rsquo;s Guide to the Federal Tax Credit for Solar
        Photovoltaics</a
      >, &ldquo;tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of
      income tax you would otherwise owe. For example, claiming a $1,000 federal
      tax credit reduces your federal income taxes due by $1,000&hellip;The
      federal residential solar energy credit can be claimed on federal income
      taxes for a percentage of the cost of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system.
      The system must be placed in service during the tax year and generate
      electricity for a home located in the United States.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Browse sites like EcoWatch that explain solar financing and net metering
      options, which can be connected to the utility company in your area. Of
      course, a great installer should be able to share these tips and tricks,
      but it is best to come armed with education before expecting a vendor to
      disclose this kind of info. These incentive programs can affect how you
      finance the installation.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can pay in cash, in installments, take out a loan or lease the solar
      panels. Each requires a different financial investment and has different
      tax consequences. Decide which method is best for you, because
      you&rsquo;ll need to explain your preferences to the installer to confirm
      that they&rsquo;ll agree to your terms. Not every installer accepts all
      payment methods. After becoming well versed in the costs and credits, then
      it is time to shop around for installers with competitive prices and
      top-notch services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Consider DIY Installation</h2>

    <p>
      According to Joshua M. Pearce, Ph.D., the John M. Thompson Chair in
      Information Technology and Innovation at Western University in Ontario,
      Canada, &ldquo;you should try to get three solar installers to give you
      quotes and, all things equal, choose the lowest $/W (cost per unit
      power)&hellip; get a free quote with some basic life cycle modeling. You
      can get a quick idea if they are legitimate if their estimates are in line
      with NREL&rsquo;s free calculator.&rdquo; Put in your address and then
      trace the estimated area to be covered with solar. This can help you
      estimate expected solar electricity generation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the initial quotes come back too high, Pearce advises a touch of DIY
      spirit. He says you can cut the cost of a solar energy system by more than
      half if you&rsquo;re willing to do some of the work on your own. He and
      Lonny Grafman, an Instructor of Environmental Resources Engineering and
      Technology at Humboldt State University, wrote a free e-book entitled To
      Catch the Sun that offers all the necessary steps to get started.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, &ldquo;Can I really install my own solar
      panels?&rdquo; The short answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; The long answer is
      &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; There are many pros and cons to setting up a DIY
      system. While the pros usually center on short-term savings, the cons
      revolve around long-term limitations. Most DIY solar panels can not be
      hooked up to the traditional electrical grid and, thus, aren&rsquo;t
      eligible for some of the tax breaks and energy credits available for
      certified installations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, if you&rsquo;d like to fully replace your home&rsquo;s entire
      electric system with a solar system, you&rsquo;ll need electrical
      experience to do so. If the thought of manual or skilled labor sounds
      beyond your depth, then hire a certified service that can get the job done
      right the first time.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Read Online and Customer Reviews</h2>

    <p>
      Online review sites, like Yelp! and Solar Reviews, can help you find
      providers in your zip code and neighborhood. Once you narrow down a few,
      be sure to use those same sites to read a healthy number of customer
      reviews. Gain insight into each company&rsquo;s customer service quality
      and credibility. These buying stories are important. They provide social
      proof and highlight red flags.
    </p>

    <p>
      Skip the star ratings without narratives. Instead, read the text to gauge
      the ease of installation, financing experiences, refund policies, and
      warranties. Don&rsquo;t dismiss a pattern of customer complaints and look
      for the company&rsquo;s response. If there&rsquo;s a rude reply or, worse
      yet, none at all, buyers should beware.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Check Licenses and Certifications</h2>

    <p>
      &ldquo;When deciding between vendors, ask them to provide a North American
      Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) certificate. NABCEP is
      the best national standard certification program, and any vendor
      possessing this accreditation is undoubtedly an expert in the
      field,&rdquo; says Alan Duncan, CEO &amp; Founder of the Solar Panels
      Network. There are many unauthorized installers on the grid who fleece
      unsuspecting customers and provide faulty service in return.<br />
      Check for valid certifications to build trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, confirm that installers have any necessary electrical or roofing
      licenses that might be needed for the type of work your home requires.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Determine Who Pays for Ancillary Services</h2>

    <p>
      Have your final two or three vendor choices take an in-person tour of your
      home to offer a comprehensive quote and to survey the size and scale of
      your space. The winner of the competition should be the one who offers
      additional services that are required to complete the work. These
      full-service installers cover energy monitoring, roof repair, tree
      removal, and installation of solar batteries, which might be required for
      solar installation in your home.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don&rsquo;t ask about these ancillary services, you might find
      yourself locked into a contract with an installer who won&rsquo;t start
      until you hire a number of other vendors. That means a longer wait for
      you. For the value, you may be better off bundling these services with a
      credible and reputable installer with many years of experience under their
      belt.
